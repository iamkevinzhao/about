## Welcome to My Corner

"There was a bird, 
    once flapped into the wind, 
        it never landed."

This is Kevin Zhao,
    a, ...well, a non-geeky geek who has been doing something called Technology. 

Eight years ago, I on-boarded.
  Four years ago, I became a professional.
    This year, however, I am back to academic.

Currently I am a master student in Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea, 
    feeling rejuvenated.
Life seems on a right track again.

Coding is my buddy, partner in crime.
  SLAM is my date.

Chn/Eng/Kor, I enjoy reading and writing.

That is all about me, 
    for those who checked out this corner.

Peace!
