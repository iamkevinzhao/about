## Welcome to My Corner

"There was a bird, once flapped into the wind, it never landed."

This is Kevin Zhao.

A, ...well, a non-geeky geek who has been doing something called Technology. 

Eight years ago, I on-boarded.  Four years ago, I became a professional.  This year, however, I am back to academic.

Currently I am pursuing a Master's degree in Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea, feeling rejuvenated.  Life seems on a right track again.

C++ is my buddy, partner in crime.  SLAM is my date.

Chn/Eng/Kor, I enjoy reading and writing.

That is all about me, for those who accidentally clicked into this corner.

Peace!
